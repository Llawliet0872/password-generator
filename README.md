# password-generator 
# Description
This password generator is done using electron js. It has a history feature which shows every password generated with the exact time and date. The history can be 
cleared. For the source code and the executable, you can just clone it or for the executable you can download the password-generator.7z for windows and linux. The MacOS files are not added yet. 
## NOTE: Do not extract the 7zip file in the 'C' drive for windows users as the history feature wont work. In case it is in the 'C' drive, administrator permissions will be needed for the .exe file to get all the features.
